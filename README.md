This project is an inventory management system that allows the user to add, delete, and modify parts and products. This project does not use a database, however, and would need to be modified to load in an inventory file or database.

In the MainMenu.java controller file (inventory/src/controller/MainMenu.java), there is some code that can be uncommented for testing (lines 47 and 56-76).
